# Priority & Ordering System

## Description
Add sprint-centric ordering to DevStories. Sprints have explicit sequence, stories have priority within sprints, epics order derived from their stories.

## Goal
Enable clear organization: know which sprint is current, which story to work on next, and see everything in logical order.

## Stories
- [[DS-079]] Sprint sequence configuration
- [[DS-080]] Story priority field
- [[DS-081]] Board view sorting + priority badge
- [[DS-082]] Tree view sorting
- [[DS-083]] Drag-drop reorder in board
