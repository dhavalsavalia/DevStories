# Housekeeping

## Description

Normalize the `.devstories/` directory to exemplary standards. Every file should demonstrate best practices for story/epic authoring.

## Why

DevStories manages its own development. If we can't maintain our own backlog cleanly, the tool fails its primary test case. This epic establishes:
- Consistent frontmatter format across all files
- Clear, actionable story content
- Accurate epic/story status alignment
- Sprint sequence that reflects reality

## Stories

- [[DS-096]] Normalize dependency format across all stories
- [[DS-097]] Add descriptions to empty story bodies
- [[DS-098]] Align epic statuses with story progress
- [[DS-099]] Standardize epic titles
- [[DS-100]] Update config with complete sprint sequence
- [[DS-101]] Final audit and verification
- [[DS-118]] Fix init.sh npm test linting
