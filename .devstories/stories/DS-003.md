# File Watcher

## Description
Set up a file system watcher to detect changes in the `.devstories` directory and trigger updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Watcher initializes with `vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher`
- [ ] `onDidCreate` event fires when a new .md file is added to `.devstories`
- [ ] `onDidChange` event fires when a file is modified
- [ ] `onDidDelete` event fires when a file is removed
- [ ] Events are debounced by 100ms (multiple rapid saves trigger one event)
- [ ] Watcher ignores files outside `.devstories` directory
