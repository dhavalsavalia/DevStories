# [[ID]] Link Detection

## Description
Implement logic to detect and resolve `[[STORY-ID]]` and `[[EPIC-ID]]` links in markdown files.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Regex correctly identifies `[[ID]]` pattern
- [ ] `LinkResolver.resolve(id)` returns absolute file path
- [ ] Handles case where ID does not exist (returns null or error)
- [ ] Supports both Story and Epic IDs
