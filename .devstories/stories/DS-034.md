# Sprint-aware status bar & picker

## Problem
The status bar currently shows a generic `$(checklist) ███░░ 8/12` with no sprint context and no interaction. Feature #10 in `docs/PRD/features/01-mvp-features.md` promised `Sprint N: ███░░ 8/12` plus a click action to focus on that sprint. Without it, solo devs lose track of what "done" means and must juggle filters manually.

## Proposal
- Read `sprints.current` (and available history) from `.devstories/config.yaml` via a shared config service.
- Display `Sprint <name>: ███░░ done/total` with a tooltip summarizing remaining stories.
- Clicking the status bar opens a sprint picker (QuickPick) that drives a shared filter state used by the tree view and board.
- Expose a `devstories.pickSprint` command so keyboard-heavy workflows can bind it.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Status bar text includes the active sprint name when available; falls back to "All Sprints" when not.
- [ ] Counts and progress bar recalc whenever stories or config change (no reload required).
- [ ] Clicking the item opens a QuickPick of available sprints (derived from config + stories) with options for All + Current + Backlog.
- [ ] Selecting a sprint updates the tree view and board filters immediately.
- [ ] Command palette entry `DevStories: Pick Sprint` invokes the same picker.
- [ ] Unit/integration tests cover sprint-aware stats and filter propagation.

## Notes
Requires the config watcher from [[DS-035]] to avoid manual reloads. Consider caching derived stats inside `StatusBarController` to avoid recomputing the whole store on every cursor move.
