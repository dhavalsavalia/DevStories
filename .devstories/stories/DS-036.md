# Quick Capture inbox triage command

## Problem
`executeQuickCapture` drops every idea into `EPIC-<prefix>-INBOX` but there is no first-class workflow to move those stories into real epics/sprints. Over time the inbox becomes a dumping ground, discouraging the capture habit.

## Proposal
- Add `DevStories: Triage Inbox` command bound to tree view + palette.
- Show a QuickPick (or multi-step input) listing inbox stories with metadata (type, size, notes) sorted by `created`.
- Provide bulk actions: assign to epic, change sprint, adjust size/type, and optionally open the story.
- Offer "Mark as archived" or "Delete" for stale captures.
- When finished, update `.devstories/epics/*` lists (auto-link) and refresh the store.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Command only appears when an inbox epic exists; otherwise offers to run Quick Capture.
- [ ] Selecting a story allows editing at least epic, sprint, size, and status in-place.
- [ ] Supports batching (e.g., select multiple stories → move to epic).
- [ ] Updates files and emits store events so tree/board reflect new locations instantly.
- [ ] Provides a summary notification (e.g., "Moved 3 stories to EPIC-002").
- [ ] Unit/integration coverage for core operations (assign, delete, archive).

## Notes
Leverage the config service from [[DS-035]] for sprint lists. This story keeps Quick Capture viable until full sprint planning (EPIC-006) lands.
