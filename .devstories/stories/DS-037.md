# Assignee command & UI surfaces

## Problem
Stories include an `assignee` field, filters exist in the board utilities, but there is no way to set or visualize ownership. Even solo devs (or AI collaborators) need to mark "who's on it" to keep context.

## Proposal
- Add `DevStories: Assign Story` command exposed in tree + board context menus.
- Default suggestions pulled from recent git authors and a configurable "me" alias.
- Support quick actions: `Assign to me`, `Clear assignee`, custom input.
- Render assignee badges in the tree (after status) and on board cards (footer chip, avatar initials).
- Extend board quick filters (`filter-chip`) with "Assigned to me" once data exists.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Command works for both story files and tree items; prompts for assignment with history + freeform entry.
- [ ] Setting/clearing assignee updates the markdown frontmatter and triggers watcher refresh.
- [ ] Tree items show assignee info in description or tooltip.
- [ ] Board cards display assignee initials badge; filter chips include "Assigned to me".
- [ ] Board assignee dropdown only shows people present in data and updates live when assignments change.
- [ ] Tests cover command flow and rendering helpers.

## Notes
Relies on live config watcher from [[DS-035]] for git-author defaults. Keep UI lightweight—avoid loading avatar images to preserve board performance.
