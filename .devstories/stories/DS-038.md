# Board polish (colors, WIP, saved filters)

## Problem
The board is functional but lacks the finishing touches promised in EPIC-005 notes. Status colors from config are unused, there's no WIP awareness, and filters reset constantly.

## Proposal
Bundle the deferred polish items into one cohesive pass:
1. **Status colors**: tint column headers/borders using `StatusConfig.color`, falling back gracefully.
2. **WIP indicators**: optional per-status limits defined in config or `boardSettings.json`. Exceeding limit adds a warning badge + subtle animation.
3. **Saved filters**: allow naming/persisting filter presets (e.g., "Now", "Next", "Bugs") stored in `vscode.Memento`.
4. **Card metadata**: show assignee chip (from [[DS-037]]), due soon indicator (if `due` field exists), and dependency count pill.
5. **Keyboard UX**: keep focus + search state stable even when incremental updates land.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Column headers/borders reflect config colors with accessible contrast and theme awareness.
- [ ] WIP limit UI can be toggled; limits configurable per status; visual warning when over limit.
- [ ] Filter bar gains a preset dropdown (save, update, delete) persisted between sessions.
- [ ] Cards display assignee initials, dependency count, and optional due badge without clutter.
- [ ] Existing keyboard navigation + drag-drop continue to work; new UI covered by tests.
- [ ] Webview states survive hot reload thanks to incremental updates from [[DS-040]].

## Notes
Coordinate with [[DS-037]] for assignee data and [[DS-040]] for incremental updates so filter preservation remains reliable.
