# Story ID utilities (open & validate)

## Problem
Developers and AI tools frequently paste `[[ID]]` references, but there is no fast way to jump to an ID or validate links. Broken links are silently skipped in `storyLinkProvider`, which hides issues until later.

## Proposal
- Add `DevStories: Open Story by ID` command with QuickPick search (fuzzy match on ID/title) backed by `Store`.
- Add `DevStories: Validate Story Links` command that scans markdown files using `utils/linkResolver`, surfaces diagnostics for missing IDs, and offers quick-fixes (create stub story, update link, remove link).
- Optionally integrate with VS Code "Problems" panel for persistent visibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Running "Open Story by ID" lists all epics/stories with icons and opens the selected file.
- [ ] Validator scans `.md` files in workspace, flags broken links with accurate line/column, and clears diagnostics when fixed.
- [ ] Quick fixes allow creating a placeholder story file (pre-filled with TODO content) or editing the link inline.
- [ ] Commands accessible via palette + tree/title menu.
- [ ] Unit tests cover link scanning + diagnostic lifecycle; integration test opens a story by ID.

## Notes
This story keeps markdown healthy ahead of sprint planning. It pairs nicely with [[DS-036]] since inbox items often contain references to new stories.
