# Open Story by ID command

## Description

QuickPick command to jump to any story/epic by typing its ID or title.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `DevStories: Open Story by ID` command in palette
- [ ] QuickPick shows all stories and epics
- [ ] Fuzzy search on both ID and title
- [ ] Icons distinguish story types and epics
- [ ] Selecting item opens the file
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut: Cmd+Shift+G (configurable)

## Technical Notes

- Use `vscode.window.showQuickPick` with `QuickPickItem[]`
- Pull items from Store.stories and Store.epics
- Show: `$(icon) DS-001 - Story Title`
- Filter using VS Code's built-in fuzzy matching
