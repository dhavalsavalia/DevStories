# Cadence reminders & ritual prompts

## Problem
Solo devs struggle to keep weekly rituals (backlog grooming, planning, retro) without a scrum master. There is no built-in reminder or gentle nudge in DevStories today.

## Proposal
- Add optional cadence configuration in `config.yaml` (`cadence.reminders` with day/time + ritual type).
- Status bar rotates contextual hints ("Retro ready? 3 stories done this week") with quick actions.
- Provide `DevStories: Start Weekly Ritual` command that steps through backlog review, planning, retro prompts.
- Use VS Code notifications for light reminders only when the workspace has active work.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Config enables/disables reminders and allows customizing cadence.
- [ ] Status bar displays next ritual + quick action button.
- [ ] Command palette entry runs a multi-step walkthrough (links to backlog, retro template, etc.).
- [ ] Reminders respect VS Code "Do Not Disturb" and only fire during active hours.
- [ ] Tests cover scheduler calculations and reminder throttling.

## Notes
Reuses status bar infrastructure from DS-034 (Phase 7). Keep everything opt-in to avoid annoyance.
