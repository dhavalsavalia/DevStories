# Definition of Done checklist surface

## Problem
Stories often reference a Definition of Done (tests, docs, review) but DevStories does not expose or track those items. Agile-minded solos want a quick visual to ensure quality gates before marking a story done.

## Proposal
- Extend story frontmatter template with optional `dod:` checklist array.
- Provide a lightweight tree/webview panel that renders checkboxes per story.
- Allow auto-check heuristics (e.g., detect recent test file changes, lint scripts) but keep manual overrides.
- Prevent status change to `done` if critical DoD items remain unchecked (configurable).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Story templates include sample `dod` entries; command can insert DoD block into existing stories.
- [ ] Dedicated "DoD" view shows progress per story and links to files.
- [ ] `devstories.changeStatus` warns (or blocks) when required DoD items are incomplete, unless override flag is set.
- [ ] Data stored in markdown so git history captures DoD state.
- [ ] Tests cover parsing, UI serialization, and guardrails.

## Notes
Keep UI minimal (checkbox list + badges). Provide telemetry hooks (optional) to learn which DoD items are most used.
