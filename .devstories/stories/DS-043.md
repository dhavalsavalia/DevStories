# Flow snapshot & metrics view

## Problem
Solo developers rarely have time to run spreadsheets for cycle time or throughput. DevStories already tracks timestamps but does not surface any flow analytics.

## Proposal
- Compute cycle time (created → done), lead time (started → done), throughput (stories/week), and WIP using existing story metadata.
- Add a compact "Flow Snapshot" webview/markdown that shows sparkline charts and highlight trends (improving/declining).
- Surface key stats in status bar tooltip and board header.
- Allow exporting metrics to markdown for sharing in retros.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Metrics auto-refresh as stories move statuses; no manual triggers required.
- [ ] Snapshot view supports dark/light themes and stays performant with 500+ stories.
- [ ] Export command writes `reports/flow-YYYY-MM-DD.md` summarizing stats.
- [ ] Tests validate metric calculations and data bucketing.

## Notes
Do not introduce external chart libraries; simple SVG or ASCII spark lines are enough. Provide config toggles for data retention windows.
