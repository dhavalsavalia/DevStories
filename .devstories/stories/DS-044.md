# Retro generator command

## Problem
Retrospectives are valuable even for solo devs, but writing them from scratch is tedious. DevStories can already see which stories closed, blockers, and carry-overs, yet no command leverages that data.

## Proposal
- Add `DevStories: Generate Retro` command that produces a markdown doc in `.devstories/retros/` with sections (What Went Well, What Was Hard, Experiments, Carry-overs).
- Prepopulate content using story metadata (e.g., fastest story, most blockers, unresolved dependencies) and Flow Snapshot stats.
- Embed quick links to improvement experiments (DS-045) and backlog items that slipped.
- Offer AI prompt scaffolding (optional) so users can expand sections quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Command asks for retro title/date range and auto-selects relevant stories.
- [ ] Generated markdown includes tables of done vs carry-over stories, notable metrics, and prompts.
- [ ] Provide option to open retro doc immediately or copy shareable summary.
- [ ] Tests ensure correct story selection and markdown formatting.

## Notes
Retro files should be git-friendly and easy to diff. Consider referencing them in README for a living changelog.
