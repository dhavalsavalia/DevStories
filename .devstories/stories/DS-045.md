# Improvement experiment tracker

## Problem
Retros highlight action items, but they often vanish. Solo devs need a lightweight way to capture experiments ("Try pair-programming with AI twice a week") and measure results.

## Proposal
- Introduce `.devstories/experiments/` with a template (goal, hypothesis, metric, outcome, next step).
- Add `DevStories: New Experiment` command that converts retro insights into experiment cards (markdown stories or dedicated files).
- Surface active experiments in the tree or status bar with quick toggles (start, pause, complete).
- Tie experiments back to stories via metadata so we can see if a change improved cycle time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Template + command create experiment files with consistent naming.
- [ ] Experiments can be linked to stories (frontmatter array) for traceability.
- [ ] View shows active experiments and reminders when check-in dates arrive.
- [ ] Closing an experiment prompts for outcome summary which gets appended to retro doc.
- [ ] Tests cover linking, reminders, and template generation.

## Notes
Keep this optional; some users may only want retros without experiments. Provide config toggle to hide experiment UI.
