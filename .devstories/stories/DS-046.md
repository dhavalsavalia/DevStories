# Agile Solo Starter template pack

## Problem
New users who want a hint of Agile ceremony are unsure where to begin. They need ready-made stories and docs (backlog grooming, retro prompts, experiment templates) to learn by doing without reading long guides.

## Proposal
- Ship a curated template pack under `.devstories/templates/agile-solo/` with:
  - Backlog grooming checklist story template
  - Weekly planning story
  - Retro/learning journal template
  - Improvement experiment story
- Provide a helper command `DevStories: Apply Agile Solo Starter` that seeds sample stories/epics using these templates (opt-in).
- Document toggles in `config.yaml` to enable cadence reminders/DoD/metrics together for quick onboarding.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Templates install with `devstories.init` (optional prompt) or via dedicated command.
- [ ] Generated sample stories live under a dedicated epic so they can be deleted cleanly.
- [ ] README/PRD reference starter pack usage.
- [ ] Tests (or smoke script) ensure templates parse and commands succeed.

## Notes
Use plain markdown so AI copilots can ingest the templates. Starter pack should be safe to delete without breaking features.
