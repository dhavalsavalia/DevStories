# First-run welcome hub + quick actions

## Problem
New installs activate the extension with no guidance. Users must find commands manually, so many churn before seeing value.

## Proposal
- Build a welcome webview that opens automatically on first activation (and via `DevStories: Open Welcome`).
- Sections: "Get Started" (Init project, Open samples), "Learn" (Tutorial, Docs), "Customize" (Enable Agile Solo Starter).
- Show recent changes and release notes for returning users.
- Track dismissal state in `context.globalState` to avoid nagging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Welcome hub opens only once per workspace unless user reopens it.
- [ ] Quick action buttons trigger commands (`devstories.init`, `devstories.quickCapture`, etc.).
- [ ] Works offline: assets bundled under `dist/webview`.
- [ ] Theme-aware layout with responsive design + hero illustration screenshot.
- [ ] Tests cover state persistence and command wiring.

## Notes
Webview should reuse board styling pipeline (esbuild). Keep markup accessible (keyboard + screen-reader friendly).
