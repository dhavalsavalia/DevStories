# First-run welcome hub + quick actions

## Problem
New installs activate the extension with no guidance. Users must find commands manually, so many churn before seeing value.

## Proposal
- Build a welcome webview that opens automatically on first activation (and via `DevStories: Open Welcome`).
- Sections: "Get Started" (Init project, Open samples), "Learn" (Tutorial, Docs), "Customize" (Enable Agile Solo Starter).
- Show recent changes and release notes for returning users.
- Track dismissal state in `context.globalState` to avoid nagging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Welcome hub opens only once per workspace unless user reopens it.
- [x] Quick action buttons trigger commands (`devstories.init`, `devstories.quickCapture`, etc.).
- [x] Works offline: assets bundled under `dist/webview`.
- [x] Theme-aware layout with responsive design + hero illustration screenshot.
- [x] Tests cover state persistence and command wiring.

## Implementation Notes
- Added `WelcomeExperience` to track dismissal per workspace via `context.globalState`.
- Implemented `WelcomeViewProvider` webview plus template/utils/actions for quick commands and release notes.
- Registered `devstories.openWelcome` command and wired auto-open flow during activation.
- Bundled offline assets (`welcome.css`, `welcome.js`, `welcome-hero.svg`) and reused build pipeline to copy into `dist/webview`.
- Wrote Vitest coverage for persistence logic, quick action wiring, template rendering, and asset helpers.

## Notes
Webview should reuse board styling pipeline (esbuild). Keep markup accessible (keyboard + screen-reader friendly).
