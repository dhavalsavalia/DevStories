# Interactive DevStories tutorial & sample workspace

## Problem
Docs alone are not enough; people need a guided walkthrough that shows commands, tree, board, cadence kit, and Agile Solo Starter features inside VS Code.

## Proposal
- Provide `DevStories: Start Tutorial` command.
- Launch a guided tour overlay (VS Code walkthrough API or custom webview) with steps and checkmarks.
- Offer to clone/open a `test-workspace/` sample that demonstrates epics, board, cadence kit toggles.
- Track completion percentage and surface in welcome hub.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Tutorial covers: init, create epic/story, quick capture, board drag/drop, Agile Solo Starter setup, cadence reminders.
- [x] Works in existing workspace or opens bundled sample workspace via VS Code `vscode.openFolder` prompt.
- [x] Progress stored per-user; command can reset progress.
- [x] Screenshots or inline gifs appear in steps (light/dark variants).
- [x] Tests ensure tutorial metadata loads and step completion logic works.

## Notes
Investigate VS Code Walkthrough contributions (`contributes.walkthroughs`) for built-in experience. Leverage DS-046 assets for sample content.
