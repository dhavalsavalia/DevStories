# Docusaurus documentation site

## Problem
Current README/PRD are developer-centric and hard to navigate for new users. We need a polished public site for launch.

## Proposal
- Scaffold Docusaurus v3 project under `docs/site/` with theme parity (dark-friendly, callouts, code blocks).
- Content pillars: Overview, Quick Start, Workflows, Cadence Kit, Tutorials, FAQ, Changelog.
- Integrate Algolia DocSearch and versioning for v0/v1.
- Deploy via GitHub Pages or Vercel with CI workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Local dev + production builds succeed (`npm run docs:start`, `docs:build`).
- [ ] Navigation includes screenshots, call-to-action buttons, and code snippets.
- [ ] Automatic deployment pipeline on main branch merges.
- [ ] README points to docs site; extension commands can open specific doc pages.
- [ ] Screenshot assets stored under `docs/site/static/img` with naming conventions.

## Notes
Coordinate with DS-050 for screenshot automation. Ensure site can embed interactive sandboxes (YouTube/GIF) for tutorials.
