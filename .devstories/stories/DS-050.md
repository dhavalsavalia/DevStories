# Screenshot automation pipeline

## Problem
Docs and tutorials need high-quality screenshots that quickly get stale. Manual capture is error-prone and slow.

## Proposal
- Use Playwright (or VS Code Extension Test runner) to launch a headless VS Code instance, perform scripted flows, and capture screenshots.
- Support dark/light themes and retina scaling.
- Store outputs under `docs/screenshots/` with metadata (scenario, date, version).
- Integrate into CI so new releases refresh screenshots automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scripts run locally (`npm run shots`) and in CI.
- [ ] At least 5 core scenarios covered (welcome hub, board, quick capture, cadence kit, tutorial step).
- [ ] Pipeline optimizes image size (WebP) and includes alt text metadata JSON consumed by docs.
- [ ] Failures reported clearly with artifacts for debugging.

## Notes
Reuse sample workspace/test fixtures for deterministic state. Consider hooking into DS-048 tutorial flows for consistency.
