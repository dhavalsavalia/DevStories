# In-editor docs navigator & contextual help

## Problem
Even with a docs site, switching to the browser breaks flow. Users need quick access to relevant guidance inside VS Code.

## Proposal
- Add `DevStories: Open Docs…` command with QuickPick linking to Docusaurus sections.
- Contextual help buttons in tree/board/status bar tooltips opening targeted doc anchors.
- Inline markdown hints (hover cards) summarizing steps with "Read more" links.
- Track most-used topics to prioritize future tutorials (optional telemetry flag).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Command lists docs by topic with search-as-you-type and opens default browser (or welcome webview embed).
- [ ] UI surfaces (board filter bar, cadence toggles) offer help icons when `config.helpHints` enabled.
- [ ] Works offline by falling back to bundled markdown excerpts.
- [ ] Tests cover command, configuration toggles, and fallback behavior.

## Notes
Ensure doc URLs stay version-aware (append `?ref=vscode`). Provide setting to disable hints entirely for power users.
