# Identify and remove unused exports/dependencies

## Description
Run static analysis tools to find and remove dead code, unused exports, and stale dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Run `npx ts-prune` to find unused exports
- [x] Run `npx depcheck` to find unused dependencies
- [x] Review findings - remove genuinely unused code
- [x] Keep intentional public API exports (parser, types)
- [x] Update imports after removals
- [x] All tests still pass after cleanup
