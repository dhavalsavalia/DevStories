# Identify and remove unused exports/dependencies

## Description
Run static analysis tools to find and remove dead code, unused exports, and stale dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Run `npx ts-prune` to find unused exports
- [ ] Run `npx depcheck` to find unused dependencies
- [ ] Review findings - remove genuinely unused code
- [ ] Keep intentional public API exports (parser, types)
- [ ] Update imports after removals
- [ ] All tests still pass after cleanup
