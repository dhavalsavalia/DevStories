# Clean up commented code blocks and stale TODOs

## Description
Review codebase for stale comments and dead code. Initial scan shows codebase is already clean - JSDoc and inline comments are legitimate.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Verify no commented-out code blocks exist (initial scan: clean)
- [x] Review any `// TODO` comments for staleness
- [x] Confirm no `// old:`, `// deprecated:` markers exist
- [x] Quick pass complete - mark done if nothing actionable found
