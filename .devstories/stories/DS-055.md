# Clean up commented code blocks and stale TODOs

## Description
Review codebase for stale comments and dead code. Initial scan shows codebase is already clean - JSDoc and inline comments are legitimate.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Verify no commented-out code blocks exist (initial scan: clean)
- [ ] Review any `// TODO` comments for staleness
- [ ] Confirm no `// old:`, `// deprecated:` markers exist
- [ ] Quick pass complete - mark done if nothing actionable found
