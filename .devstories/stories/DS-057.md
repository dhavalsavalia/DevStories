# Replace empty catch blocks with proper error handling

## Description
Fix silent catch blocks that swallow errors without logging or user notification.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fix createStory.ts:38-40 empty catch block
- [ ] Fix createStory.ts:59-61 empty catch block
- [ ] Fix similar patterns in quickCapture.ts
- [ ] Add error logging or user notification to all catch blocks
- [ ] Search for `catch { }` or `catch (e) { }` patterns - none should remain
