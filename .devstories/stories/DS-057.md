# Replace empty catch blocks with proper error handling

## Description
Fix silent catch blocks that swallow errors without logging or user notification.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Fix createStory.ts:38-40 empty catch block
- [x] Fix createStory.ts:59-61 empty catch block
- [x] Fix similar patterns in quickCapture.ts
- [x] Add error logging or user notification to all catch blocks
- [x] Search for `catch { }` or `catch (e) { }` patterns - none should remain

## Decisions
- **Category-based handling**: Catch blocks handling config-not-found scenarios use `getLogger().debug()`, while failures that show user errors also log to warn level.
- **Comment-only for expected scenarios**: File existence checks (e.g., checking if .devstories exists) keep minimal comments since these are expected code paths, not errors.
- **Utils files stay pure**: *Utils.ts files (changeStatusUtils, configServiceUtils, boardViewUtils, initUtils) don't import logger - they return defaults silently since the parent caller can handle logging.
