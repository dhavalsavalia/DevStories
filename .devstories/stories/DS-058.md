# Add production ESLint rules

## Description
Add stricter ESLint rules to prevent common issues and maintain code quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Add `no-console: error` rule
- [x] Add `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: error` rule
- [x] Add `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises: error` rule
- [x] Run lint and fix all violations
- [x] CI passes with new rules

## Decisions
- Added `parserOptions.project` to enable typed linting (required for `no-floating-promises`)
- Added `webview/` to `ignorePatterns` since those are plain JS files
- Used `void` operator for fire-and-forget promises (VS Code API calls like `showInformationMessage`)
- Added eslint-disable comments for console in test runner files (legitimate use case)
