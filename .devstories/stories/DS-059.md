# Replace 'any' types with proper interfaces

## Description
Fix type safety issues by replacing `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Fix tutorialService.ts:33 `any` type
- [x] Review and fix ~30 `any` instances (excluding test files)
- [x] Add proper types for webview message payloads
- [x] ESLint no-explicit-any rule passes
- [x] No runtime type errors after changes

## Decisions
Story was already complete - work was done as part of DS-058:
- tutorialService.ts doesn't exist (stale reference)
- No `any` types in source files; 8 in test files have proper eslint-disable
- Webview types defined in `src/types/webviewMessages.ts`
- ESLint `no-explicit-any: error` passes with 0 errors
