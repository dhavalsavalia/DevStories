- [ ] Add `role="region"` and `aria-label` to columns: "{status} column, {count} stories"
- [ ] Add `aria-label` to search input: "Search stories"
- [ ] Add `aria-label` to filter dropdowns: "Filter by {type}"
- [ ] Add visible keyboard focus indicators (outline/ring on :focus-visible)
- [ ] Manual test: navigate board with Tab key, verify logical focus order
- [ ] Manual test: enable VoiceOver (Cmd+F5), verify card content is announced
