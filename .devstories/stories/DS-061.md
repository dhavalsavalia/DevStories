# Implement accessibility in welcome and tutorial webviews

## Description
Add ARIA labels to welcome.js and tutorial.js interactive elements. These views are simpler than the board but still need screen reader support.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] welcome.js: Add `aria-label` to "Start Tutorial" and "Create First Story" buttons
- [ ] welcome.js: Add `role="link"` and `aria-label` to documentation links
- [ ] tutorial.js: Add `aria-label` to step navigation buttons (Next, Back, Skip)
- [ ] tutorial.js: Add `role="progressbar"` with `aria-valuenow` to step indicator
- [ ] Focus management: auto-focus first button when view opens
- [ ] Manual test: Tab through welcome view, verify all actions accessible
