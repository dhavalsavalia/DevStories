## Description
Security audit of all innerHTML usage in webviews to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Any user-controlled content (story titles, descriptions, epic names) must be properly escaped before rendering.

- [ ] Verify escapeHtml() covers: `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`, backtick
- [ ] Add unit tests for XSS edge cases (nested tags, script injection, event handlers)
- [ ] Add CSP meta tag to board webview HTML template
