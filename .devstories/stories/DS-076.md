# Create devstories-core package with shared logic

## Description
Extract headless core into standalone npm package for multi-platform support.

- [ ] Abstract file system operations (injectable fs interface)
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for core
- [ ] Publish to npm as @devstories/core
- [ ] Document public API

## Technical Notes
Use dependency injection for file system to support different platforms.
