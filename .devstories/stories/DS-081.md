# Board view sorting and priority badge

## Description
Sort stories within board columns by priority and show priority badge on cards.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Sort stories within columns: blocked deps last → lower priority first → created date
- [x] Update `groupStoriesByStatus()` in board.js to apply sorting
- [x] Add small priority badge to card UI (e.g., "[10]")
- [x] Badge only shows if priority is set (not default 500)
- [x] Blocked stories visually distinct (dimmed or badge)
- [x] Tests for sorting logic
