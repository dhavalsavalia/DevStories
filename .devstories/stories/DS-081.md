# Board view sorting and priority badge

## Description
Sort stories within board columns by priority and show priority badge on cards.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Sort stories within columns: blocked deps last → lower priority first → created date
- [ ] Update `groupStoriesByStatus()` in board.js to apply sorting
- [ ] Add small priority badge to card UI (e.g., "[10]")
- [ ] Badge only shows if priority is set (not default 500)
- [ ] Blocked stories visually distinct (dimmed or badge)
- [ ] Tests for sorting logic
