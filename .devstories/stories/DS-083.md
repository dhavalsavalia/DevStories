# Drag-drop reorder in board

## Description
Enable drag-drop to reorder stories within a column by updating their priority.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Detect vertical reorder vs cross-column status change
- [ ] Calculate new priority: average of neighbors (above + below / 2)
- [ ] Handle edge cases: first position (priority = above - 10), last position (priority = below + 10)
- [ ] Send `updatePriority` message to extension
- [ ] Extension writes updated priority to story file
- [ ] Refresh board after write
- [ ] Tests for priority calculation
