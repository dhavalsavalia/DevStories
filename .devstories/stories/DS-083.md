# Drag-drop reorder in board

## Description
Enable drag-drop to reorder stories within a column by updating their priority.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Detect vertical reorder vs cross-column status change

- [x] Send `updatePriority` message to extension
- [x] Extension writes updated priority to story file
- [x] Refresh board after write
- [x] Tests for priority calculation
