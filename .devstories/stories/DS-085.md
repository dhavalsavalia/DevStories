# Field name completions

## Description

CompletionItemProvider that suggests frontmatter field names (id, title, status, epic, etc.) when typing in frontmatter.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Typing at line start in frontmatter shows field suggestions
- [ ] Only suggests fields not already present
- [ ] Shows field description in completion detail
- [ ] Different suggestions for story vs epic files (stories have `type`, `size`, `dependencies`)
- [ ] Trigger on empty line or partial field name

## Technical Notes

- Register `CompletionItemProvider` for markdown language
- Check `isInFrontmatter()` before providing completions
- Read field definitions from schema (hardcoded initially, could use config later)
- Story fields: id, title, type, epic, status, sprint, size, assignee, dependencies, created, updated
- Epic fields: id, title, status, created
