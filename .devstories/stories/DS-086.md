# Field value completions

## Description

Extend CompletionItemProvider to suggest valid values for enum fields after typing the field name and colon.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `status:` suggests values from config.yaml statuses (todo, in_progress, review, done)
- [ ] `type:` suggests feature, bug, task, chore
- [ ] `size:` suggests from config.yaml sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- [ ] `sprint:` suggests from config.yaml sprints.sequence
- [ ] `epic:` suggests existing epic IDs from Store
- [ ] Shows colored icons for status values matching board colors

## Technical Notes

- Trigger character: `:` (after field name)
- Read enums from Store.config for dynamic values
- Use `CompletionItemKind.EnumMember` for enum values
- Epic suggestions need Store access - lazy load if not ready
