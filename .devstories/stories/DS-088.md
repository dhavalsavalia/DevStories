# ID link completions in frontmatter

## Description

Extend completions to suggest story/epic IDs when typing in `dependencies` array or `epic` field, with preview of the referenced item.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] In `dependencies:` array, suggest all story IDs except self
- [ ] In `epic:` field, suggest all epic IDs
- [ ] Completion detail shows title of referenced story/epic
- [ ] Filter suggestions as user types partial ID
- [ ] Works for both inline `[DS-001, DS-002]` and block array syntax

## Technical Notes

- Detect array context vs single value context
- Pull IDs and titles from Store
- Use `CompletionItemKind.Reference` for ID completions
- Consider sorting by relevance (same epic first for dependencies)
