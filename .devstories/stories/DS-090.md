# Broken link diagnostics

## Description

Report broken `[[ID]]` links as VS Code warnings in the Problems panel. Extends DS-087's diagnostic infrastructure to cover markdown content, not just frontmatter.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `[[INVALID-ID]]` shows warning squiggle on the link
- [ ] Warning message: "Story/Epic 'INVALID-ID' not found"
- [ ] Broken links appear in Problems panel
- [ ] Diagnostics update when referenced story is created/deleted
- [ ] Severity: Warning (not error) - broken links don't block work

## Technical Notes

- Extend DiagnosticCollection from DS-087
- Scan full document, not just frontmatter
- Use existing linkResolver to check ID existence
- Debounce with frontmatter validation (same 200ms timer)
