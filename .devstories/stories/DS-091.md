# Quick fix for broken links

## Description

CodeActionProvider that offers quick fixes when cursor is on a broken link diagnostic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Lightbulb appears on broken `[[INVALID-ID]]` links
- [ ] Quick fix options:
  - "Create story INVALID-ID" - creates stub story file
  - "Remove link" - replaces `[[ID]]` with just `ID`
  - "Change to..." - shows picker with similar existing IDs (fuzzy match)
- [ ] Created stub story has TODO placeholder content
- [ ] After fix, diagnostic clears

## Technical Notes

- Register `CodeActionProvider` for markdown
- `provideCodeActions` checks if diagnostic is from our collection
- Stub story uses template from config.yaml
- Fuzzy match: Levenshtein distance or simple prefix match
