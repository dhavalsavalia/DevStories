# Wiki-link autocomplete ([[)

## Description

CompletionItemProvider that suggests story/epic IDs when typing `[[` anywhere in markdown content.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Typing `[[` triggers completion list
- [ ] Shows all story and epic IDs with titles
- [ ] Icons distinguish stories vs epics
- [ ] Filter narrows as user types ID prefix
- [ ] Selecting inserts `[[DS-001]]` (with closing brackets)
- [ ] Works in both frontmatter and markdown body

## Technical Notes

- Trigger characters: `[` (check for `[[` pattern)
- Use `CompletionItemKind.Reference`
- Pull from Store.stories and Store.epics
- Sort: epics first, then stories by ID
- insertText should include closing `]]`
