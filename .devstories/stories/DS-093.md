# Backlinks index and panel

## Description

Build a reverse index of story references and expose via a dedicated sidebar panel showing "what links here".

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Store maintains backlinks Map: `storyId -> Set<referringStoryIds>`
- [ ] Index updates on file change (debounced)
- [ ] "Backlinks" tree view in sidebar (below Stories)
- [ ] Shows stories that reference the currently open file
- [ ] Clicking backlink opens that file
- [ ] Empty state: "No references found"

## Technical Notes

- Build index during Store.load() by scanning all `[[ID]]` patterns
- Update incrementally on file save
- TreeDataProvider for backlinks panel
- Register view in package.json contributes.views
- Track active editor to know which file's backlinks to show
