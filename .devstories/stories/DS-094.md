# Enhanced hover previews

## Description

Extend existing HoverProvider with richer information: backlinks, epic progress, dependency warnings.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hover on `[[EPIC-ID]]` shows "3/5 stories done" progress
- [ ] Hover shows "Referenced by: [[DS-002]], [[DS-005]]" section
- [ ] Hover on story with unfinished dependencies shows warning icon
- [ ] Quick action links in hover: "Open file", "Change status" (as markdown links)

## Technical Notes

- Extend existing hoverProvider.ts
- Query backlinks index from DS-093
- Calculate epic progress from Store
- Check dependency status from Store
- Use `vscode.MarkdownString` with `isTrusted: true` for command links

## Extracted From

- DS-018: "Backlinks section in hover"
- DS-018: "Progress in epic hover"
- DS-018: "Dependencies warning"
- DS-018: "Quick actions in hover"
