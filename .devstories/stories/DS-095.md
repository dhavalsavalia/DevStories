# Peek definition and go to references

## Description

Implement DefinitionProvider and ReferenceProvider to enable Alt+F12 peek and Shift+F12 find references on `[[ID]]` links.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Alt+F12 on `[[DS-001]]` opens inline peek showing story file
- [ ] F12 on `[[DS-001]]` navigates to story file (go to definition)
- [ ] Shift+F12 on `[[DS-001]]` shows all places that reference DS-001
- [ ] Works on story IDs in frontmatter dependencies array too

## Technical Notes

- `DefinitionProvider`: Return Location pointing to story file line 0
- `ReferenceProvider`: Query backlinks index, return Location[] for each reference
- Register both for markdown language
- Pattern match: `\[\[([A-Z]+-\d+)\]\]`

## Extracted From

- DS-017: "Peek definition: Alt+F12 inline preview"
- DS-017: "Go to references: Find all stories that link to current story"
