# Align epic statuses with story progress

## Description

Update epic statuses to accurately reflect their story completion. An epic with some done stories should be `in_progress`, not `todo`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] EPIC-007 status updated to `in_progress` (DS-034, DS-035 done)
- [x] EPIC-008 status updated to `in_progress` (DS-041 done)
- [x] EPIC-009 status updated to `in_progress` (DS-047, DS-048 done)
- [x] All epics with done stories are at least `in_progress`
