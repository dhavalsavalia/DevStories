# Remove board view code

## Description

Remove all board view related code to simplify the extension for 1.0.0 release.

## Checklist

- [x] Delete `src/view/boardView.ts`
- [x] Delete `src/view/boardViewUtils.ts`
- [x] Delete `src/types/webviewMessages.ts`
- [x] Delete `webview/board.js`
- [x] Delete `webview/board.css`
- [x] Delete `src/test/suite/boardView.test.ts`
- [x] Delete `src/test/unit/boardView.test.ts`
- [x] Remove board view from `package.json` contributes.views
- [x] Remove BoardViewProvider from `src/extension.ts`

## Decisions

Most files were deleted in a prior cleanup. This story only required removing dangling imports/references from `extension.ts`.
