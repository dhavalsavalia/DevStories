# MCP server with read resources

## Description

Implement MCP server that exposes DevStories data to AI agents like Claude Code and Cursor.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP server starts with extension activation
- [ ] Resource: `devstories://stories` - List all stories
- [ ] Resource: `devstories://epics` - List all epics
- [ ] Resource: `devstories://story/{id}` - Get story details
- [ ] Resource: `devstories://epic/{id}` - Get epic details
- [ ] Resource: `devstories://config` - Get config (statuses, sprints)
- [ ] Works with Claude Code via MCP configuration

## Technical Notes

- Create `src/mcp/server.ts` for MCP server setup
- Create `src/mcp/resources.ts` for read handlers
- Use existing Store for data access
- Follow MCP SDK patterns
