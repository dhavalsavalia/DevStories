# Tree view sorting with alphabetical fallback

## Description
Enhance tree view sorting to use alphabetical title ordering when stories have the same priority. Current sort order is Sprint → Priority → Created date. When priority equals default (500), stories should sort alphabetically by title instead of by created date for more predictable ordering.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Stories with explicit priority sort by priority (lower = higher)
- [x] Stories with default priority (500) sort alphabetically by title (case-insensitive)
- [x] Stories with same non-default priority fall back to alphabetical title
- [x] Sprint sorting takes precedence over priority sorting
- [x] Epic sorting remains unchanged (derived from earliest story sprint)

## Technical Notes
- Modify `sortStoriesForTreeView()` in `src/view/storiesProviderUtils.ts`
- Change tertiary sort from `a.created.getTime() - b.created.getTime()` to `a.title.localeCompare(b.title)`
- Update tests in `src/test/unit/treeViewSorting.test.ts` with new cases
