# Add Open Story action to quick capture notification

## Description
After quick capture creates a story, the success notification should include an "Open Story" button. Clicking it opens the story file. This preserves the quick capture philosophy (don't interrupt flow) while giving users easy access when they want to add details.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Success notification shows "Open Story" action button
- [x] Clicking button opens the story markdown file in editor
- [x] Dismissing notification (or clicking elsewhere) does nothing
- [x] Story file path is correctly resolved for opening
- [x] Notification message remains: "Created {id}: {title}"

## Technical Notes
- Modify `quickCapture.ts` line 229 to use `showInformationMessage` with action items
- Use `vscode.workspace.openTextDocument()` + `vscode.window.showTextDocument()` pattern
- Reference `createStory.ts` line 405 for file opening pattern
- Add integration test for notification action
