# Cross-file frontmatter validation

## Description

Validate frontmatter fields that reference other files - epic references, dependencies, and [[links]].

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Validate `epic` field references existing epic
- [ ] Validate `dependencies` array entries exist
- [ ] Validate `[[ID]]` references in markdown body resolve
- [ ] Validate IDs are unique across all stories/epics
- [ ] Warnings for orphan stories (epic doesn't list them)
- [ ] Diagnostics update when referenced file changes

## Technical Notes

- Requires Store to be loaded for lookups
- May need FileWatcher integration to revalidate on external changes
- Consider performance for large workspaces
