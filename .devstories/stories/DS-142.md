# Config validation with user feedback

## Description

Show notifications when config.yaml changes, so users know if their edits were valid.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] On parse error: show warning "Config has errors, using previous valid config"
- [x] Include "Open Config" action button on error

## Technical Notes

Modify src/core/configService.ts to add vscode.window notifications
