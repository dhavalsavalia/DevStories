## Launch Posts

### Reddit (r/vscode, r/programming)

**Title:** I made a VS Code extension for story management using markdown files

**Post:**
I wanted project context inside my editor and accessible to AI tools. So I built DevStories.

**What it does:**
- Stories live as markdown files in `.devstories/` — version-controlled with your code
- Quick capture with `Cmd+Shift+S` to jot ideas without leaving the editor
- Hover over `[[STORY-001]]` links to see full story cards inline
- Tree view with sprint filtering
- Templates for different story types

**Why markdown?**
- AI tools can read it. Copilot knows your context
- Git blame shows who changed what and when
- Works offline
- Stories travel with the codebase

Built it using itself — 98 stories, 14 epics. MIT licensed.
