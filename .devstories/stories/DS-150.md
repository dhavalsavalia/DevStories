# Hover preview for bare IDs in frontmatter

## Description

Extend hover provider to show previews for bare `DS-XXX` and `EPIC-XXX` patterns in YAML frontmatter, not just `[[ID]]` in markdown body. This makes dependency arrays hoverable without changing syntax.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hovering over `DS-XXX` in frontmatter `dependencies:` array shows story preview
- [ ] Hovering over `EPIC-XXX` in frontmatter `epic:` field shows epic preview
- [ ] Existing `[[ID]]` hover in markdown body still works (no regression)
- [ ] Bare IDs in markdown body do NOT trigger hover (only frontmatter)
- [ ] Parser logic unchanged - dependencies still stored as plain strings

## Technical Notes

- Modify `src/providers/storyHoverProvider.ts`
- Detect if cursor position is within frontmatter (lines between `---` markers)
- If in frontmatter, match bare ID pattern; if in body, require `[[]]` wrapper
- Reuse existing `formatHoverCard` logic
