# Fork-safe PR workflow

## Description

Create a separate workflow for fork PRs that doesn't expose secrets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/pr-fork.yml`
- [ ] Use `pull_request` event (not `pull_request_target`)
- [ ] Run lint + unit tests only (no integration tests)
- [ ] Never expose secrets to fork PRs
- [ ] Use `actions/checkout` with explicit ref for fork safety
- [ ] Document security model in CONTRIBUTING.md
