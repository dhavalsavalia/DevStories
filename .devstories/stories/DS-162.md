# Fork-safe PR workflow

## Description

Create a separate workflow for fork PRs that doesn't expose secrets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `.github/workflows/pr-fork.yml`
- [x] Use `pull_request` event (not `pull_request_target`)
- [x] Run lint + unit tests only (no integration tests)
- [x] Never expose secrets to fork PRs
- [x] Use `actions/checkout` with explicit ref for fork safety
- [x] Document security model in CONTRIBUTING.md
