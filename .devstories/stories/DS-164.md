# Auto-release workflow on tag

## Description

Automatically publish to VS Code Marketplace when a version tag is pushed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- [x] Trigger on push of version tags (`v*.*.*`)
- [x] Run full test suite before release
- [x] Build with `npm run package`
- [x] Create GitHub Release with auto-generated notes
- [x] Upload `.vsix` as release asset
- [x] Publish to VS Code Marketplace using `vsce publish`
- [x] Store `VSCE_PAT` as repository secret (manual setup)
- [x] Document release process in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Notes

Strategy: Trigger on tag push (not release creation) for fully automated releases.
- Push tag → CI runs → Tests pass → Build → Publish to marketplace → Create GitHub release
- Requires discipline: only push tags when ready to release
