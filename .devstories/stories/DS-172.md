# Migrate to ESLint 9 flat config

## Description

Migrate from ESLint 8 with legacy `.eslintrc.json` config to ESLint 9 with flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`). This addresses Dependabot PRs #4 and #5.

## Checklist

- [x] ESLint upgraded to ^9.39.1
- [x] @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin upgraded to ^8.48.1
- [x] @typescript-eslint/parser upgraded to ^8.48.1
- [x] `.eslintrc.json` converted to `eslint.config.mjs` (flat config)
- [x] All existing rules preserved
- [x] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] CI passes
- [ ] Dependabot PRs #4 and #5 closed

## Decisions

- Removed `@typescript-eslint/semi` rule (deprecated in v8, replaced with standard `semi`)
- Didn't include `eslint.configs.recommended` or `tseslint.configs.recommended` to match previous behavior (only specific rules we want)
- Added `typescript-eslint` package which provides the unified flat config API
