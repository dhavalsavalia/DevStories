# Parse error user notifications

## Description

Store catches parse errors but only logs them. When a story/epic has malformed frontmatter, it silently vanishes from the tree view. Users think their data is lost.

## Affected Files

- `src/core/store.ts:100-108` - `parseAndAddStory()` catch block
- `src/core/store.ts:110-118` - `parseAndAddEpic()` catch block

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Show VS Code error notification when parse fails
- [ ] Notification includes file name
- [ ] "Open File" button navigates to problematic file
- [ ] Debounce notifications to prevent spam during batch saves
