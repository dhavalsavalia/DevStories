# Config fallback notifications

## Description

ConfigService silently falls back to defaults when config.yaml is invalid. User edits config, saves, and wonders why changes aren't applied.

## Affected Files

- `src/core/configService.ts:96-99` - Silent fallback to `lastGoodConfig`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Warning toast when config.yaml can't be parsed
- [ ] Message indicates which file and what went wrong
- [ ] Extension still works (graceful fallback)
- [ ] User is informed their config is being ignored
