# Empty state tree guidance

## Description

When there are no epics, the tree view shows nothing - blank sidebar. New users don't know what to do next.

## Affected Files

- `src/view/storiesProvider.ts:38-59` - `getChildren()` returns empty array

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Empty tree shows "No epics yet" message
- [ ] Message or button triggers "Create Epic" command
- [ ] Disappears once first epic is created

## Closed

Duplicate of [[DS-138]]. Already implemented with `viewsWelcome` in package.json and context keys in `welcomeContext.ts`.
