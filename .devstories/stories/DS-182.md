# Epic title 200 char limit

## Description

Epics limited to 100 characters, stories get 200. Arbitrary inconsistency - epics are larger organizational units and should have at least equal title length.

## Affected Files

- `src/utils/inputValidation.ts` - Epic title validation
- `schemas/epic.schema.json:15` - `maxLength: 100`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Epic titles allow up to 200 characters
- [ ] Schema and runtime validation aligned
