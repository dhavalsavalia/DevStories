# Epic stories section validation

## Description

Epic files have a `## Stories` section with wiki links. This should be validated against actual `story.epic` fields for bidirectional consistency.

## Affected Files

- `src/validation/frontmatterValidator.ts` - Epic content validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Warning if story in `## Stories` doesn't have matching `epic:` field
- [ ] Warning if story has `epic: EPIC-XXX` but isn't in epic's `## Stories`
- [ ] Bidirectional validation ensures consistency
- [ ] Parse `## Stories` section and extract wiki links
