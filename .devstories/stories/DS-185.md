# Derive epic status from stories

## Description

Remove epic `status:` field from frontmatter. Epic status should always be derived from its stories - zero maintenance, always accurate.

## Derivation Logic

- All stories in first status (todo) → epic is `todo`
- Any story in middle status → epic is `active`
- All stories in last status (done) → epic is `done`
- No stories → epic is `todo`

## Affected Areas

- Epic type definition - make status optional/computed
- Parser - don't require status for epics
- Tree view - compute status from stories
- Hover provider - compute status from stories
- Schema - make status optional

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Epic status is derived from stories, not stored
- [ ] Tree view shows correct derived status
- [ ] Hover preview shows correct derived status
- [ ] Epic files without `status:` field work correctly
- [ ] Existing epics with `status:` field still work (graceful migration)
