Story: DS-020 (Kanban Board UI)
Status: done

Work done:
- Created kanban utility functions in `src/view/boardViewUtils.ts`:
  - `getTypeIcon()`: Returns emoji for story type (feature/bug/task/chore)
  - `groupStoriesByStatus()`: Groups stories by status for column rendering
  - `getStoriesForColumn()`: Gets stories for a specific column
- Updated `webview/board.css` with full kanban styles:
  - Board container with horizontal scroll
  - Fixed-width columns (260px) with vertical scroll
  - Card layout with header, title, footer
  - Type-specific left border colors
  - Empty column state
- Replaced placeholder `renderBoard()` in `webview/board.js` with full implementation:
  - `groupStoriesByStatus()`: Client-side grouping
  - `renderColumn()`: Renders column with header and cards
  - `renderCard()`: Renders card with type icon, ID, size, title, epic, deps
  - `getEpicName()`: Resolves epic ID to title
  - `escapeHtml()`: XSS prevention
  - Scroll position persistence (board + columns)
- Added 11 new unit tests for kanban utilities (36 total in boardView.test.ts)

MVP Acceptance Criteria:
- ✅ Board renders columns from config.yaml statuses
- ✅ Stories render as cards in correct columns based on status
- ✅ Cards display: ID, Title, Type icon, Size badge
- ✅ Columns show count of stories
- ✅ Horizontal scroll for many columns, vertical scroll within columns
- ✅ Empty column state: "No stories" placeholder
- ✅ Color coding: Subtle color hints based on type (left border)

Enhanced features deferred:
- WIP limits, Swimlanes, Compact/expanded view, Story count by type, Card hover

Tests: 246 unit + 94 integration = 340 total passing

Project Status: 22/25 stories done (88%)
- Phase 5 (Board View): 2/5 done

Next story: DS-021 (Drag-and-Drop)

MVP Acceptance Criteria:

Enhanced Acceptance Criteria:
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (j/k/h/l, arrows, Enter, Space, 1-4)

- ⏸️ Touch support (deferred)
- ⏸️ Multi-select drag (deferred)

Story: DS-033 (Load .devstories on extension activation)
Status: done

Bug fix: Extension wasn't loading story data on activation.

Root cause:
1. `store.load()` called but NOT awaited in extension.ts
2. `store.load()` didn't fire `onDidUpdate` event after completing

Fix applied:
1. Changed `activate()` to async and await `store.load()`
2. Added `_onDidUpdate.fire()` at end of `load()` method

Files changed:
- src/extension.ts (await store.load())
- src/core/store.ts (fire onDidUpdate after load)
- src/test/suite/store.test.ts (new test: onDidUpdate fires after load)

Tests: 303 unit + 106 integration = 409 total passing (+1 new)

Story: DS-026 (Fix search input blur on first keystroke)
Status: done

Bug fix: Board filter search input loses focus after first keystroke.

Root cause:
- `renderBoard()` replaces entire DOM on filter change
- Debounced search input triggers `onFilterChanged()` -> `renderBoard()`
- Focus lost when innerHTML is replaced

Fix applied:
1. Save focus state and cursor position before DOM re-render, restore after
2. Skip keyboard navigation when user is focused on input/select/textarea elements

Files changed:
- webview/board.js (renderBoard() focus preservation + handleKeydown() input check)
- .devstories/stories/DS-026.md (marked done)

Tests: 303 unit + 106 integration = 409 total passing (no new tests - fix is in webview JS)
