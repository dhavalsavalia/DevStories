# Vision

**DevStories: Lightweight story management in VS Code. No JIRA. No bloat. Just markdown.**

## The Problem

Project management tools have become unnecessarily complex:

- **JIRA/Linear/etc.** require separate apps, logins, and subscriptions
- Stories live in external databases, disconnected from code
- Offline work is impossible or painful
- Exporting data means fighting with limited export options
- Syncing issues create constant frustration
- Cost: $7-15/user/month adds up fast

## The Solution

DevStories brings story management INTO your codebase:

- Stories are markdown files in `.devstories/`
- Git is your sync mechanism
- VS Code is your interface
- Free, forever
- Works offline by default
- You own the data - it's just markdown

## Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Solo developers who don't want heavy PM tools
- Small teams (2-5 people) tired of JIRA bloat
- Open source maintainers managing contributions
- Developers who live in VS Code

**Secondary:**
- Larger teams looking to simplify their workflow
- Teams using AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot)

## Value Proposition

| Traditional PM Tools | DevStories |
|---------------------|------------|
| Separate app, separate login | Lives in VS Code |
| Stories in external DB | Stories in your repo |
| Sync nightmares | Git IS the sync |
| $7-15/user/month | Free, forever |
| Offline? Good luck | Works offline |
| Export? Maybe PDF | It's already markdown |

## The AI Angle (Bonus)

AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot Workspace) need structured context to be effective. When stories live in your repo as markdown files, AI tools can read them naturally - no special integration needed.

This isn't the primary value prop (we're NOT just "for AI users"), but it's a powerful bonus for teams using modern AI-powered development workflows.
