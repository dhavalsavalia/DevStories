I am not the best developer in the world when it comes to being structured and to stay on course. As I fully embraced my "vibe coding" arc, I was doing to what any developer with idea does, I started building an MVP for an HRIS application. The scope was huge and my ADHD-brain attention span was not at all set up for success. That's why I needed a project management tool as a solo developer. Claude Code (CC) is my preferred choice of AI coder, and "accidentally" I found a workflow that worked pretty good for me. Well, it wasn't really an accident, its really what developers have been doing for eons. Use stories, epics and sprints! Surprising, I know!

In my research, I found first choice JIRA and Linear to be somewhat limiting as fact that I needed to create an account and manage outside service or spin up my own container. Any either case those tools were overkill for what I needed. I just needed to write my epic themes, group a bunch of stories in it and bundle all in manageable sprints. I was already using markdown for this anyways with CC and just ask CC to read them and implement them one at a time. Later, CC was managing whole epics, stories and sprints but one of a limiting factors with LLMs was their nondeterministic behavior. At times, it would write something strage to stories or deviate from format algother, no matter how good of instructions I wrote beforehand.

That's when I got into a bit of a run and decided to build a plugin around managing project a tiny bit better. I am calling it DevStories. It is a simple markdown based project management tool that allows me to write epics, stories and sprints in markdown files and manage them with simple JSON config file. The plugin reads the config file and markdown files and presents them in a simple UI. I can then ask CC to read the files and implement them one at a time. The best part is that I can version control the files and keep track of changes over time.

Now that I was building this, I decided to drink my own kool-aid and use DevStories to manage DevStories development itself. So far, it has been working pretty well for me. I can easily add new stories, epics and sprints as needed and CC is able to read them and implement them without any issues. There is still nondeterministic behavior at times but overall, it has been a great experience. The entire project was built over a weekend and there is some AI slop here and there but hey, that's what MVPs are for! I am excited to see how DevStories evolves over time and how it can help other solo developers like me manage their projects better.
